\item Let $X$ be a random variable with probability density function
\begin{align}\
f(x) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{x^2} & x \geq 1 \\
0             & otherwise.
\end{cases}
\end{align}
If $Y = \log_e X$, then $\pr{Y<1 | Y<2 }$ equals

\item The probability of a person telling the truth is 4/6 . An unbiased die is thrown by
the same person twice and the person reports that the numbers appeared in both
the throws are same. Then the probability that actually the numbers appeared in
both the throws are same is ?
