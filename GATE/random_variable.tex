\item A cytoplasmic male-sterile female plant with the restorer (nuclear) genotype $rr$ is crossed to a male-fertile male plant with the genotype $RR$. Both $RR$ and $Rr$ can restore the fertility, whereas $rr$ cannot. When an $F1$ female plant with $Rr$ genotype was test-crossed to a male-fertile male plant with the $rr$ genotype, the percentage of the population that is male fertile would be?
